REALNAMES
=========

A project at the University of Oxford to investigate the relationship between pseudonymity and online content.

This repository is the  engine that will collect data from three sites. 

In particular, we are interested in comments and replies to British MPs and Premier League Footballers. 

HOUSEKEEPING 
============
The requirements.txt file is used by pip for installing / freshening python packages. 

The credentials directory holds the application secret keys, hence ignoring the contents.

The python files are in a worker directory. 

The lists of subreddits, twitter accounts and youtube accounts are in the accounts directory.
